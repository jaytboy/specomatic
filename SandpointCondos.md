Garage ventilation requirements:
Below are specifications by the International Mechanical Code (2015) regarding enclosed parking garage ventilation requirements. 

404.1 Enclosed Parking Garages

Where mechanical ventilation systems for enclosed parking garages operate intermittently, such operation shall be automatic by means of carbon monoxide detectors applied in conjunction with nitrogen dioxide detectors. Such detectors shall be installed in accordance with their manufacturers' recommendations.

404.2 Minimum Ventilation

Automatic operation of the system shall not reduce the ventilation airflow rate below 0.05 cfm per square foot (0.00025 m3/s • m2) of the floor area and the system shall be capable of producing a ventilation airflow rate of 0.75 cfm per square foot (0.0038 m3/s • m2) of floor area.

404.3 Occupied Spaces Accessory to Public Garages

Connecting offices, waiting rooms, ticket booths and similar uses that are accessory to a public garage shall be maintained at a positive pressure and shall be provided with ventilation in accordance with Section 403.3.1.

This project is for a garage floor space of 10,125 sqft. 

-	Full load: 		10,125 sqft x 0.75 cfm/sqft = 7,600 cfm
-	Intermittent load: 	10,125 sqft x 0.05 cfm/sqft = 510 cfm

This system would need to perform at least 26,250 cfm when running at full capacity and 1,750 cfm on intermittent mode. This is an estimate and does not include areas such as connecting offices, waiting rooms, ticket booths, etc. and does not reflect the final system requirements.
